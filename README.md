    - [ ] Move to containerisation to run multiple instances
    - [ ] Move to Ollama

## Project Overview
This final project is inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s **LLM Council** concept: instead of relying on a single Large Language Model (LLM), multiple LLMs collaborate by answering, reviewing, and synthesizing responses to a user query.

In the original implementation, the system relies on cloud-based models accessed via OpenRouter.  
Your task is to **refactor and extend** this system so that the entire LLM Council runs **locally**, using tools such as:

- Ollama (recommended)  
- GPT4All  
- Llamafile  
- Hugging Face  
- LangChain  

The end result should be a **distributed multi‑LLM system** in which multiple machines communicate over a network to form an LLM Council, producing a final synthesized output generated by a dedicated **Chairman LLM**.

## What Is the LLM Council?
The LLM Council is a **multi-stage reasoning system**:

1. **Multiple LLMs answer** the same user query independently  
2. LLMs **anonymously review and rank** each other’s answers  
3. A **Chairman LLM synthesizes** all outputs into a final response  
4. The user can inspect intermediate model outputs  

This approach emphasizes diversity of reasoning, self‑critique, and aggregation of perspectives.

## Council Workflow

### **Stage 1: First Opinions**
- The user submits a query  
- Each LLM generates an answer independently  
- All responses are displayed in a tabbed interface  

### **Stage 2: Review & Ranking**
- Each LLM is shown the responses from the others  
- Model identities are anonymized  
- Each LLM ranks the responses based on:
  - Accuracy  
  - Insight  

### **Stage 3: Chairman Final Answer**
The Chairman LLM:
- Receives all original responses  
- Receives all review rankings  
- Produces a **single synthesized final answer**  

## Project Goal
Refactor the original LLM Council implementation so that:

- ❌ Cloud-based APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc.) are removed  
- ✅ All LLMs run locally  
- ✅ The system supports multi-machine communication via REST APIs  
- ✅ The full 3‑stage workflow functions end-to-end  

This project focuses on distributed AI architecture and practical deployment of local LLMs.

## Mandatory Technical Requirements

### **1. Local LLM Execution**
Replace OpenRouter with local inference using one of:

- Ollama (recommended)  
- GPT4All  
- Llamafile  
- Hugging Face  
- LangChain  

### **2. Distributed Architecture**
- Each team must run **at least 3 LLMs on separate PCs**  
- The **Chairman LLM must run on a separate machine**  
- All machines communicate via REST APIs (e.g., Ollama API)  
- At least **two council LLMs must run on different machines**

#### **Team Configurations**
- **Solo project:**  
  All LLMs may run on one PC (if hardware allows)

- **Group of 2:**  
  - Chairman LLM on PC #1  
  - All council LLMs on PC #2  

- **Group of 3–5:**  
  - Chairman LLM on a dedicated PC  
  - At least two council LLMs each on separate PCs  

### **3. Chairman Separation**
The Chairman must:

- Run as a **separate service**  
- Use its **own model instance**  
- Only **synthesize** responses (not generate first opinions)  


## 👥 Team Requirements

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:

- Collaborate on refactoring and extending an existing codebase  
- Understand and modify a real-world multi‑LLM system  
- Design and implement distributed AI systems  
- Deploy and manage local LLMs  
- Gain hands-on engineering experience beyond prompt engineering  

## Generative AI Usage & Penalties

### **Allowed**
Use of Generative AI tools (LLMs) is permitted.

### **Mandatory Declaration**
Teams must include a **Generative AI Usage Statement** specifying:

- Which tools/models were used  
- For what purpose (e.g., refactoring, documentation, debugging, design)  

This must appear in the README or technical report.

### ⚠️ **Penalty Policy**
Failure to declare AI usage or attempting to hide it will result in:

- Severe penalties  
- Possible grade reduction  
- Potential non-compliance classification  

Transparency is mandatory. Declared usage **does not** negatively affect evaluation.

# LLM Council

![llmcouncil](header.jpg)

The idea of this repo is that instead of asking a question to your favorite LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI GPT 5.1, Google Gemini 3.0 Pro, Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5, xAI Grok 4, eg.c), you can group them into your "LLM Council". This repo is a simple, local web app that essentially looks like ChatGPT except it uses OpenRouter to send your query to multiple LLMs, it then asks them to review and rank each other's work, and finally a Chairman LLM produces the final response.

In a bit more detail, here is what happens when you submit a query:

1. **Stage 1: First opinions**. The user query is given to all LLMs individually, and the responses are collected. The individual responses are shown in a "tab view", so that the user can inspect them all one by one.
2. **Stage 2: Review**. Each individual LLM is given the responses of the other LLMs. Under the hood, the LLM identities are anonymized so that the LLM can't play favorites when judging their outputs. The LLM is asked to rank them in accuracy and insight.
3. **Stage 3: Final response**. The designated Chairman of the LLM Council takes all of the model's responses and compiles them into a single final answer that is presented to the user.

## Vibe Code Alert

This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack because I wanted to explore and evaluate a number of LLMs side by side in the process of [reading books together with LLMs](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438). It's nice and useful to see multiple responses side by side, and also the cross-opinions of all LLMs on each other's outputs. I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.

**Backend:**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

Get your API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/). Make sure to purchase the credits you need, or sign up for automatic top up.

### 3. Configure Models (Optional)

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize the council:

```python
COUNCIL_MODELS = [
    "openai/gpt-5.1",
    "google/gemini-3-pro-preview",
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "x-ai/grok-4",
]

CHAIRMAN_MODEL = "google/gemini-3-pro-preview"
```

## Running the Application

**Option 1: Use the start script**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Option 2: Run manually**

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
uv run python -m backend.main
